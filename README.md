# Ethmail
A de-centralized mailing app using Embark framework.

The goal of Ethmail.tech is to send encrypted emails on the blockchain using public key encryption. All encryption and decryption is done client side, with smart contracts used to manage ownership. There are features built into the contract not yet implemented by the client, although at some point I do envision a version two of the contract.

I welcome pull requests and bug reports.

To Use: Visit the site using the Mist browser or Metamask, generate or supply a PGP public key to enable your account to recieve mail.

To Build: Install embark and run 'embark run' to build and deploy.
